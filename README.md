## Definitions To Ponder ðŸ¤”

- Why do we need to find Jacobian for a system of Non-Linear ODE?

The system's _small signal stability_ is investigated using the Jacobian matrix. By solving the equation f(Xo,Uo) = 0, the equilibrium point Xo is determined. The components of this Jacobian matrix will be utilised to accomplish the sensitivity result, and it is obtained from the state matrix.

Here, _Small Signal Stability_ is a term used to describe the stability of small signals. When a system is subjected to tiny perturbations or a small disturbance of state of equilibrium, such as gradual changes in system load, small signal stability refers to the system's capacity to sustain stable voltages.

- What is the phycial significance of eigenvalues ?

The *eigenvalues* indicate the value of a system property in a stationary state, i.e. the system may attain that state given specific conditions, and the eigenvalues represent the value of that property in that stationary state.
